## ðŸš€ DSA Tips

1. **Solve Independently**  
   Always try to solve problems on your own first. If you refer to a solution, ensure you understand it thoroughly so that you wonâ€™t need to revisit it.

2. **Optimize for Speed**  
   Aim to solve each problem as quickly and efficiently as possible.

3. **Dry Run with Odd Test Cases**  
   Manually test your solution with at least two non-trivial or edge (odd) test cases to verify correctness.
   
## ðŸ§  Maximize Your Focus  
**Use the maximum of your brain and utilize each minute.** Stay sharp and intentional with your time and attention.
